Q1: intended functionality of two programs `server.c` and `client.c` (in 100 words)?
A1: 
    - `server.c` creates a server socket on a particular port, listening for client connections. 
        Once it accpts a client connection, it creates a socket, reads the file and 
        writes the file contents into the socket stream buffer.
    - `client.c` attempts to connect to the same port the server is listening on. 
        Once connection established, the client can read the contents from the socket stream buffer, 
        and print the contents to the stdout (the console).

Q2: find three programming errors in the code.
A2: 
    - 1. in the `server.c` file, we require 3 input arguments, but it says 2 in code below.
    \*
    if (argc != 2)
    {
        puts("Usage: server <port> <file>");
        return 1;
    }
    *\

    - 2. in the `server.c` file, the int main(int argc, char *argv) function lacks one closing parenthese.
    - 3. in the `server.c` file, the variable `w` is not initialised when used in the while loop.
    \*
    int r, w;
    r = fread(bytes, sizeof(char), BUFSIZE, fp);
    while (w < r) {...}
    *\

Q3: how the request is being served and how the brower is interpreting the response?
